        Emmanuel is a smart, pleasant, and self-motivated developer, who is a brilliant addition to any team. He combines experience with outside-the-box thinking to approach both business and technical problems with workable solutions. Letting him loose on a task is as good as knowing it's done already - and that the end result is going to be efficient, maintainable and scalable. A pleasure to work with.
