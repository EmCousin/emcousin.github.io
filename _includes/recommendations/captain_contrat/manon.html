        Emmanuel was my internship supervisor during my first web experience in a company.
        He was attentive and instructive throughout my time at Captain Contrat, allowing me to make significant progress and become independent quickly.
        Emmanuel is curious, always seeking better solutions and exploring new technologies, and his expertise continually evolves. His curiosity extends to other aspects of the project, and he has consistently been a great help during non-technical meetings.
        I highly recommend Emmanuel; he is a passionate mentor and colleague who is always eager to advance the projects he works on.
