# Hi! I'm Emmanuel.

I’m French, I’m a software engineer. I craft beautiful and useful solutions on the Web for a living, mostly using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

The Web is a reflection of our everchanging world ; it's up to us to make it a better and safer place for everyone. I've been spending the last 10 years honing my web development skills so I can do my part.

I’m a freelancer open to opportunities. Have a project, or just a good feeling about me? Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emmanuel@hey.com)!

You can also reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emcousin/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cousinemmanuel/).
