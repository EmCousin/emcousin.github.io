# Hi! I'm Emmanuel.

I’m French, I’m a software engineer. I craft beautiful and useful solutions on the Web for a living, mostly using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

The Web being merely a reflection of our everchanging world, I am convinced it is up to us to make it a better, safer, more open place for everyone. I believe I can do my humble part using my professional skills on the Web to follow that path.

I’m a freelancer open to opportunities. Have a project, or just a good feeling about me? Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:emmanuel@hey.com)!

You can also reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emcousin/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cousinemmanuel/).
