  <h3 class="font-bold leading-loose">Hi! I'm Emmanuel.</h3>

  <p>I’m French, and I work as a software engineer. I build beautiful and useful solutions on the web for a living, primarily using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

  <p>I've spent the last 10 years honing my software crafting skills and contributing to making the web a better place.</p>

  <p>I’m a freelancer open to opportunities. If you have a project or just a good feeling about me, feel free to <a href="/resume">check my resume</a> or <a href="mailto:emmanuel@hey.com">send me an email</a>!</p>

  <p>You can also reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/emcousin/">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cousinemmanuel/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
